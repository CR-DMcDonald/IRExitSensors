## High Power LED IR Matrix 10W, 750 m,

Good balance of range and power requirements for a handheld device.

### Power
Specs say 4v-5v, 900ma but given it'll be run on a duty cycle you might be able to get more.

* So far it it has run well from a 8.4v power source, through a 1Î© resistor, and run various signal patterns without burning out. For example, uses less than  1.5 watts total power consumption.
