# IRExitSensors

This repo is for interested hardware hackers and red teamers to share timing details for various IR Door Sensors.

### NT Series

Very common in the UK. The OEM doesn't ever seem to be specified on listing or the device itself, but suspected to be [YLI](https://www.yli.cn/en/product/Button/Infrared-Sensor/).

### Capacitive Devices

These devices look a lot like IR touchless exit buttons, some are even advertised as such, but actually use capacitive sensors which are touch or have a range of about an inch.
