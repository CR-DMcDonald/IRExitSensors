# IRExitSensors

This repo is for interested hardware hackers and red teamers to share timing details for various IR Door Sensors.

### NT Series

Very common in the UK. The OEM doesn't ever seem to be specified on listing or the device itself, but suspected to be [YLI](https://www.yli.cn/en/product/Button/Infrared-Sensor/).

### TODO

Following devices are on the todo list, have been ordered, or are still be tested
* AMS-EBIR3-RG

### Capacitive Devices

These devices look a lot like IR touchless exit buttons, some are even advertised as such, but actually use capacitive sensors which are touch or have a range of about an inch.

* [unknown-00](unknown-00.md) no model number and unbrand fake IR sensor
* [HBK-E02](hbk-e02.md)
