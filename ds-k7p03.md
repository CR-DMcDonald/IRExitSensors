### Device Description

The Hikvision DS-K7P03 (and it's slimline variant DS-K7P04) have a circular metal bezel with a frosted look around the IR filter. The filter has a distinctive (((üñê))) print. The internal light bleed is sufficient that the internal pcb can just be seen.

It is suspected that [yli.cn](https://www.yli.cn/en/product/Button/Infrared-Sensor/) might be the OEM for this sensor but that is not proven.
